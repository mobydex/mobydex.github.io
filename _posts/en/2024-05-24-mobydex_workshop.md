The second consortium meeting took place today at the University of Duisburg-Essen. In the morning, we first discussed the current development status of the partners. We then further refined the overall concept for the MobyDex platform. The work is progressing well. 


In the afternoon, we invited representatives from the Rhine-Ruhr transport association (Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr) and discussed possible points of contact. The discussions were extremely interesting and we learnt a lot about the VRR's work. We are looking forward to further cooperation.
