## Liability for content

The content of this website has been created with the utmost care. However, no liability is assumed for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents.


As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According to §§ 8-10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. As soon as we become aware of such infringements, the content will be removed immediately.

## Liability for links

This website contains links to third-party websites (‘external links’). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators, so that the University of Duisburg-Essen accepts no liability for this third-party content. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation, so that the University of Duisburg-Essen hereby expressly distances itself from all content of the linked pages that was changed after the link was created. Liability for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information lies solely with the provider of the page to which reference is made, not with the person who refers to the respective publication via links.
