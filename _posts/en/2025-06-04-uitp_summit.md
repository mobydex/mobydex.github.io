From June 15 to 18, 2025, Hamburg hosted the UITP Global Public Transport Summit. The UITP Summit showcases solutions from companies, cities, countries, and regions around the globe. The Technologieregion Karlsruhe (TRK) presented itself—confident as always—among global metropolises and was officially designated as a UITP training location.

MobyDex participated at the joint booth of the Karlsruhe Mobility Lab from the Technologieregion Karlsruhe (TRK).We showcased our comparative service analysis, an interactive data lab for demand analysis, GIS tools for planning support, and an initial draft of the Corporate Mobility Management System. We had exciting conversations, made new contacts, and gained valuable insights for further development and application of our solutions. The impressions of many systems and innovations in mobility planning and management—and not least the host city Hamburg, whose public transport system including harbor ferries we were able to use for free as participants—rounded off the experience.
