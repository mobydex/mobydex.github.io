On 14 March, the fourth MobyDex consortium meeting took place at CISS TDI GmbH. Sinzig is located in the beautiful Ahr valley west of the Rhine. The local sights include Sinzig Castle and St Peter's Church, which we were able to see on the way to lunch.

In the morning, we first discussed the progress made in the individual work packages and agreed on the next steps. In the afternoon, we mainly focussed on integration issues and the concrete calculation of various components of the demand index. We also began preparations for our planned participation in the UITP Summit 2025 in Hamburg.

As you can quickly see from the pictures, the meeting was very productive and a lot of fun. Many thanks to the hosts. We are looking forward to the upcoming exchange with all partners and users at our upcoming trade fair appearance at the UITP Summit 2025 in Hamburg in June.
