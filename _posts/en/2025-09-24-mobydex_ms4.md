On September 24, 2025, the MobyDex team celebrated an important achievement: Milestone 4 was successfully completed! To mark the occasion, the project partners gathered for a joint meeting at CAS Software AG in Karlsruhe.

We were especially pleased to welcome Barbara Schmitz from the DLR project management agency, who joined us to get a first-hand impression of the project’s progress. In a collaborative and open atmosphere, the team presented their work to date and showcased the latest prototypes for supply and demand analysis as well as for corporate mobility management.

Following the presentations, the next steps in the project were discussed and defined – with plenty of great ideas and clear goals. The meeting was a great success and once again demonstrated the strong, solution-oriented collaboration within the consortium.
