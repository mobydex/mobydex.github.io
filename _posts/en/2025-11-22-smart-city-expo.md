From November 4 to 6, 2025, we were represented with Moby Dex at the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona – one of the world’s most important trade fairs for urban innovation, mobility, and digitalization. Together with various partners from Germany, we presented ourselves at the joint Bavaria booth and used the international stage to introduce our project to a broad trade fair audience.

Our participation was part of our activities within the framework of funding by mFUND and the Federal Ministry for Digital and State Modernization (BMDS). For us, the Expo offered an ideal opportunity both to provide insight into our work and to showcase the current state of our research.

Of particular importance to us was the direct exchange with our target group: transport planners. We wanted to better understand their needs and perspectives and have our Moby Dex dashboard evaluated directly on site. The personal feedback from the professional visitors was extremely valuable to us: many confirmed the relevance of our approaches and made concrete suggestions that can be incorporated into further development.

In addition, we were able to conduct numerous focused discussions and establish exciting new contacts – both with municipal representatives and with research partners and companies working in the field of data-driven mobility planning. These impulses will be particularly valuable for us in the upcoming project phases.

Our conclusion: Participation in the Smart City Expo 2025 was a great success for Moby Dex. The intensive exchange has strengthened our commitment to developing digital tools for mobility planning in a practical, application-oriented way and to continuously improving them through dialogue with the professional community. We are taking many new ideas and contacts back from Barcelona and are already looking forward to the next steps in the project.
