Once again this year, we were able to successfully submit a contribution to the Science Forum Mobility in Duisburg. Together with the employees of the University of Duisburg-Essen, employees of LocosLab GmbH and CAS Software AG will present their results on the topic ‘An Analysis of Bike Sharing Availability and Demand for MobyDex’. Further information will soon be available on the [event website (in German)](https://wifo-mobilitaet.de/).
