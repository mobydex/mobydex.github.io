Next Thursday, 13 June 2024, the annual Science Forum Mobility will take place in Duisburg. MobyDex will be there with the presentation ‘MobyDex: A Platform for Analysing Multimodal Mobility Systems’. The presentation will take place in Session 2 (Track 4) around 12.30 pm. 


In addition to interesting dialogue partners, we are of course also looking forward to numerous exciting presentations. Registration is still possible. Further information can be found on the [website of the Science Forum (in German)](https://wifo-mobilitaet.de/). See you there!
