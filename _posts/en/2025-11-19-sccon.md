Smart Country Convention (SCCON) 2025 is one of the leading events for digital innovation in the public sector. From October 22 to 24, 2025, the trade fair opened its doors in Berlin and offered a wide range of topics related to Smart City, Smart Region, digital infrastructure, and data-driven solutions.

[ui!](https://www.umi.city/) was represented with its own booth and presented the funded project Moby Dex. The project focuses on the analysis and provision of mobility data to support municipalities and companies in traffic planning and mobility management. The demand for such solutions was clearly evident in the discussions with professional visitors and stakeholders.

In addition to the project presentation, networking and exchange were key priorities. Numerous discussions with representatives from municipalities, companies, and research institutions provided valuable insights into current challenges such as data integration, digital platforms, and the implementation of intelligent services. The response underscored the importance of data-driven approaches for sustainable mobility.

SCCON also offered the opportunity to learn about trends such as digital infrastructure, open data, and smart mobility. These topics shaped the discussions and highlighted how crucial cooperation between public and private stakeholders is for the future of mobility.
