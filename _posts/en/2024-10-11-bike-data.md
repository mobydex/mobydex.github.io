Today we have provided historical data on the availability of rental bikes in the pilot regions of MobyDex. The data can currently be accessed via [Github](https://github.com/mobydex/bike-availability) and soon also via the [Mobilithek](https://mobilithek.info/). To simplify the implementation of weather-dependent analyses and forecasts, we have blended the data directly with open data from the [German Weather Service (DWD)](https://www.dwd.de). A detailed description of the processing and the data format can be found in the associated README file.
