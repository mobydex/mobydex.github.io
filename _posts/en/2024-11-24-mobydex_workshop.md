Today, the third consortium meeting took place at CAS Software AG in Dobel, a picturesque community in the northern Black Forest at an altitude of around 700 metres. In the morning, we first discussed the current status of the work packages. The progress is very promising. We then presented the results of a mobility survey, which were visualised both in figures and as a heatmap on a map. The corporate mobility management (BMM) solutions developed in the process were discussed in depth.


In the afternoon, we gave two presentations: the first on data sources for mobility offers, the second on the development of an assistance tool for infrastructure expansion. This was followed by a lively discussion on the challenges associated with these topics. At the end of the meeting, we discussed the overall architecture of a possible BMM demonstrator.


The meeting was once again very productive and characterised by an atmosphere of trust. We look forward to further collaboration.
